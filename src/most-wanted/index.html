            Everyone who collects vinyl has a list. This list may be written
            down, catalogued in an app, or just a nebulous idea floating about
            in their head. I am, of course, referring to the namesake of this
            experiment: the "most wanted" list.

            While some factors besides enjoyment or replayability of a record
            play into desire for physical media (rarity probably being the most
            prominent), I wanted to see if I could quantify exactly which
            records should be on my list based on those factors. To do so, I
            first grabbed a list of my records from Discogs and normalized the
            response. Then, I requested my most played albums from Last.fm, and
            displayed the first 25 I didn't already own on physical media on
            this very page.
